# Likeness & Consent Policy

**Effective Date**: February 2026  
**Version**: 1.0

## Introduction

Cinemai Pro Agents is committed to the ethical and legal use of AI-generated content. This policy outlines the rules and requirements for using virtual presenters, avatars, and AI-generated voices on our platform.

**By using avatar features on this platform, you agree to comply with this policy.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. No Impersonation Without Consent

You **MUST NOT** use the platform to impersonate real people without their explicit, documented consent. This includes:

- Creating videos that claim to feature a real person who did not participate
- Using AI to mimic the voice, face, or mannerisms of a real person
- Generating content that misleads viewers into believing a real person endorsed a product or message

### 2. Use Fictional or Stylized Avatars

You **MUST** use:
- Clearly fictional characters
- Stylized or abstract avatars
- Generic representations that do not claim to be real people

### 3. No Public Figures Without Rights

You **MUST NOT** use the likeness, voice, or identity of public figures (celebrities, politicians, influencers, etc.) unless:

- You have explicit, documented rights and licenses from the individual
- You have written authorization from their legal representatives
- You are creating clearly labeled parody or satire that complies with applicable laws

### 4. Clear AI Disclosure

All AI-generated content **MUST**:
- Include clear disclosure that the video uses AI-generated avatars
- Not mislead viewers about the nature of the content
- Comply with platform-specific disclosure requirements (e.g., Twitter Community Notes, YouTube AI disclosure)

## Legal Considerations

### Right of Publicity

Using someone's likeness without permission may violate their **right of publicity**, which protects individuals from unauthorized commercial use of their identity.

### Defamation

Creating false or misleading content about real people may constitute **defamation** and expose you to legal liability.

### Intellectual Property

Using copyrighted material (including the likeness of fictional characters owned by others) may violate **copyright or trademark laws**.

### Platform Terms of Service

Content created with Cinemai Pro Agents must also comply with the Terms of Service of platforms where you publish (Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, etc.).

---

## Consent Documentation

If you have explicit consent to use someone's likeness, you must:

1. **Obtain written consent** that includes:
   - Name of the individual
   - Description of how their likeness will be used
   - Duration of consent
   - Signature and date

2. **Keep records** of consent for at least 3 years

3. **Provide upon request** if your content is flagged for review

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Disclose AI-Generated Content

Add text overlays, captions, or descriptions that clearly state:
- "This video features an AI-generated avatar"
- "No real person was depicted in this video"
- "AI-generated for illustrative purposes"

### 2. Use Generic Avatars

Choose avatars that are:
- Clearly stylized or cartoon-like
- Not modeled after real people
- Appropriate for your content

### 3. Avoid Misleading Context

Ensure your video does not:
- Claim to be footage of a real event
- Suggest endorsement by a real person
- Misrepresent the nature of the content

### 4. Respect Privacy

Do not use AI to create content about private individuals without their consent, even if technically allowed.

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be:
- Announced via email to all users
