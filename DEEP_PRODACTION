1. New feature layer: “Shorts mode”

Alongside Simple and Pro, add:

• Shorts mode:• Input options:• Text idea → “Write me a script for…”

• Existing video → auto-cut best moments.

• AI does:• Generates hook-first scripts.
• Suggests 3–5 variants per idea.
• Auto-adds captions, emojis, on-screen text.

• Output formats:• 9:16 (TikTok/Reels/Shorts).

So app has 3 entry points:

• Photo + Script (Cinematic)
• Production Pack (Pro)
• Shorts (Growth)

Add a “Publish” layer on top of productions:

• Connected accounts:• TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, X, etc. (via OAuth).

• Suggested titles, descriptions, hashtags.

• main_video_url
• created_at

• short_variants• id
• short_id
• hook_text
• caption_text
• hashtags
• format (9_16, 1_1, 16_9)
• video_url
• performance_score (nullable, from analytics)
• created_at



Social connections & posts

• social_accounts• id
• user_id
• platform (tiktok, instagram, youtube, x, etc.)

5. AI pipeline extension for shorts

1. Idea/script generation• From user prompt or long script.
• Generate multiple hook-first scripts.

2. Shot planning• For each script:• Decide if it’s:• Talking head.
• B-roll heavy.
• Mixed.



3. Visual generation• If user has a photo/avatar:• Use it as anchor.

• Else:• Generate stylized visuals (Neo Glow, etc.).


4. Caption & layout• Auto-generate:• Word-perfect captions.
• Emphasis with emojis, bold words (visually).

• Place them in safe zones for each platform.

5. Export & variants• Render multiple aspect ratios.

6. Publish & learn• Post via connected accounts.

6. Pricing with Short.ai-style value

Your existing model still works, just add Shorts framing:

• Free:• X cinema productions/month.
• Y shorts/month.
• Limited platforms, no scheduling.

• Pro ($49/month):• More cinema productions.
• More shorts (e.g. 100–300/month).
• Scheduling + multi-platform posting.
• Brand kit.
• Analytics.

• $1 Trip:• 1 cinema production or
• A bundle of shorts (e.g. up to 5 variants from one idea).



You can later split into:

• CinemAi Pro (cinema-focused).
• Creator Pro (shorts + growth).
• Or keep it unified but message it differently.

7. Neo Glow UI with growth layer

Keep the same Neo Glow aesthetic, but:

• Growth cards:• Neon borders showing platform colors subtly.
• Tiny metrics row: views, likes, watch time.

• Hook lab:• Terminal-like panel with glowing cursor.
• Generated hooks appear as stacked cards you can swipe through.

8. How this is now “beyond CinemAi + Short.ai”

You’re combining:

• Deep production (multi-folder, contracts, code, assets).
• Cinematic output (full productions).
• Short-form growth engine (hooks, shorts, scheduling, analytics).


So the story becomes:

“Upload your world once—get full cinematic pieces and an ongoing stream of optimized shorts that auto-grow your channels.”
